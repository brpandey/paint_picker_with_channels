# PaintPickerWithChannels

### Description
Fun little web app that uses Elm and Phoenix to select paint cans (Phoenix db backend uses Postgres) 

Instead of requesting JSON from an API endpoint we use web socket channels via Phoenix Channels 
and also Elm ports to communicate with JS and the Phoenix channel!!

Now our paint can selects are stored within the DB using web socket channels!!!
